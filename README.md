# eShop
## Overview
In many cases, e-commerce can reduce the way to resell a product from producer to consumer. The biggest advantage of e-commerce is a significant reduction in the cost of the transaction and its subsequent maintenance. The most famous example of e-commerce is an online store, which is a web resource with a catalog of products and the ability to order and pay for goods that the buyer liked. That is, any goods become available from anywhere on the planet. An online store is a convenience not only for buyers but also for owners. This is an opportunity for them to open their own business, which does not require rent investment.
